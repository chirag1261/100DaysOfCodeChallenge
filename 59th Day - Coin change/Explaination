You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of 
coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1. You may assume that you have an infinite 
number of each kind of coin.
We have to find some subproblem that will help in solving coin-change problem. Given an amount n, we want to generate an exact change using the fewest number of coins of 
denominations d1 < d2 < â€¦ < dm.

Let Dp(n) represent the minimum number of coins required for a given amount n. Coins dj can be added to amount n - dj only if dj <= n and 0 <= j <= n -1 wher Dp(0) is 0.

Let us proceed with following test case

coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11
