 The simplest approach to solve this problem is to traverse the array and generate all possible subsequence of the given array and calculate their sums. Print the longest
 of all subsequences with maximum sum. 

Time Complexity: O(N * 2N) 
Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Efficient Approach: The problem can be solved using Greedy technique. Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

    Initialize a variable, say maxm, to store the largest element of the given array.
    If maxm < 0, then print the value of maxm.
    Otherwise, traverse the array and print all positive array elements.
