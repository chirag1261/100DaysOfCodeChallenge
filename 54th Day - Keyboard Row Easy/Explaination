Given an array of strings words, return the words that can be typed using letters of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.

In the American keyboard:

    the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
    the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
    the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm"
    
    The approach is pretty straightforward. We can hash all the indices to their rows and check that every character for every string in the array has the same value hashed 
    to it. But we need to hash for all 26 characters first in order to preprocess the hashing part. Based on that, we can store them in an array and return it.
Algorithm

    Create a HashMap<Character, Integer> rowId and an array result to store resultant strings
    Initialize a boolean variable same_row = true to run checks on strings
    Hash all the characters to their rows
    For every string str in the array:
        set same_row = true
        For every character chr in the array starting from the second:
            If the rowId[chr]Â is not equal to rowId[first_character]:
                set same_row = false and jump to next string
        If same_row == true:
            Push it to result
    Return result
