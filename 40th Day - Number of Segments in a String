class Solution {
    public int countSegments(String s) {
        int segmentCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if ((i == 0 || s.charAt(i-1) == ' ') && s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                segmentCount++;
            }
        }

        return segmentCount;
    }
}

To count the number of segments, it is equivalent to count the number of string indices at which a segment begins. Therefore, by formally defining the characteristics of 
such an index, we can simply iterate over the string and test each index in turn. Such a definition is as follows: a string index begins a segment if it is preceded by
whitespace (or is the first index) and is not whitespace itself, which can be checked in constant time. Finally, we simply return the number of indices for which the 
condition is satisfied.
