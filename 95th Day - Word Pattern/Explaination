Word Pattern LeetCode Solution – We are given 2 strings – “s” and “pattern”, we need to find if the pattern follows s. Follows here means full match. More formally, we can 
for every pattern[i] there should only be one s[i] and vice versa i.e. there is a bijection between a letter in a pattern and a non-empty word in s.
Examples and Explanation

Example 1:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Explanation:
a -> dog
b -> cat

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
Explanation:
a -> dog
b -> cat
pattern[3] = a which corresponds to s[0], dog defined earlier, but s[3] has no dog

Example 3:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
Explanation:
a -> dog
Two different a are defined, i.e. dog and cat

Approach

We will map the words in s to their corresponding letters in the pattern. If pattern[i] already exists, then check if s[i] is equal to pattern[i]. To map pattern[i] and worlds
in “s”, let’s use hashmaps.

Since the words are given through a single string s, we can define another array of strings to store all the words for easy implementation. Iterate through the string s, if 
there is space, push the word into our string array.
