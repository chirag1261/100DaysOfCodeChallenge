Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

For example, given n = 12, return 3 because 12 = 4 + 4 + 4; given n = 13, return 2 because 13 = 4 + 9.

Solution 1. According to Lagrange's four-square theorem(please wiki/google), any positive number can be represented as 4(at most) square number sum.

    divide by 4, notice that, 2 and 8, 3 and 12, 4 and 16 has the same number of square factors.
    if number%8==7, this result in a square factors 2^2 + 1 +1 +1, which is four.
    if any two numbers can suqare sum to n, return 1 or 2.
    otherwise result is 3.
    
DP. this is a forward dp question, using an array dp[], dp[i] means the number need to square-sum up to i, then, for all the j from 1 to i+jj <=n; calculate dp[i+jj] = ?, 
initially set each dp[i] equals to max.    

Example 2:

Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 104
