Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Thought Process

    Hash Table
        Use count array to store the frequency of character, increase for string s and decrease t
        Loop from letter a to z, the first encounter of count = 1 is our answer
        Time complexity O(n)
        Space complexity O(n) or O(1)
    Sum
        Similar to above, we add the character from s and deduct the character from t
        The final sum is the character
        Time complexity O(n)
        Space complexity O(1)
    XOR
        XOR all the character
        Time complexity O(n)
        Space complexity O(1)
