A number n is a power of 4 if the following conditions are met. 
a) There is only one bit set in the binary representation of n (or n is a power of 2) 
b) The count of zero bits before the (only) set bit is even.
For example 16 (10000) is the power of 4 because there is only one bit set and count of 0s before the set bit is 4 which is even.

Example 1:

Input: n = 16
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: true

 

Constraints:

    -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
